This Swift framework makes it surprisingly easy to start creating amazing shapes using a turtle. It is a  [turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)  engine written in Swift.

The commands and samples were implemented with reference to the book [Turtle Geometry](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4663/Turtle-GeometryThe-Computer-as-a-Medium-for). In that book you will also  find a lot of interesting  samples.


## Example Usage

```swift
// Create your own command
extension Turtle {
    func myCommand() -> Self {
    	  // Basic Commands
        forward(100).right(90)
        forward(100).right(90)
        forward(50).right(90)
        forward(50).right(90)
        forward(100).right(90)
        forward(25).right(90)
        forward(25).right(90)
        forward(50)
        return self
    }
}

// Create image with runner
let image = TurtleRunner().run() { üê¢ in
    for _ in 1...4 {
        üê¢.myCommand()
    }
}
```
